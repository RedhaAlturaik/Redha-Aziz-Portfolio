# Redha-Aziz-Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The website showcases my skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and responsive layout.

Key features include:
Responsive navigation with mobile menu
Dark mode toggle with saved preference
Dynamic project cards generated from JavaScript
Active navigation highlighting (scroll spy)
Custom contact form validation
This project demonstrates practical front-end development skills and structured JavaScript implementation.

Setup Instructions (Run Locally)
git clone https://github.com/REDHA-AZIZ/YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME.git

Navigate into the project folder:
cd YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME

AI Usage Summary:
AI was used as a learning assistant and debugging tool.
The most technically challenging JavaScript parts where AI guidance was helpful include:
Implementing the IntersectionObserver scroll spy to highlight the active navigation link.
Structuring the dynamic project rendering system using map() and template literals.
Designing the dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence.
All final code was reviewed, understood, and adapted manually.
