## Setup Instructions (Run Locally)
- git clone https://github.com/REDHA-AZIZ/Redha-Aziz-Portfolio.git

## Navigate into the project folder:

## AI Usage Summary:
AI was used as a learning assistant and debugging tool.
The most technically challenging JavaScript parts where AI guidance was helpful include:
- Implementing the IntersectionObserver scroll spy to highlight the active navigation link.
- Structuring the dynamic project rendering system using map() and template literals.
- Designing the dark mode toggle with localStorage persistence.
All final code was reviewed, understood, and adapted manually.
